# Programming Foundations CA

In this project I have used a TV as an object displayed on a website.
I started off by reading and watching the 2 modules - then I started planning the project in Figma.
I got a good understanding of making an object in JavaScript, but I struggled a lot with functions.
Therefore, I asked Talitha for help, who provided me with good explanations and a better understanding.
I might have overcomplicated this project, but I feel like I have learnt a lot more this way.

Thank you very much for your time and patience Talitha.
